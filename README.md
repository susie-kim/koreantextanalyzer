# kortextanalyzer

Korean Text Analyzer is a web dashboard that parses and analyzes texts written in Korean. The list of grammar and vocabulary are based on: 
* Cho et al., (2019). *Integrated Korean: Beginning 2* (3rd edition). University of Hawaii Press.
* Cho et al., (2020). *Integrated Korean: Intermediate 1* (3rd edition). University of Hawaii Press.
* Cho et al., (2020). *Integrated Korean: Intermediate 2* (3rd edition). University of Hawaii Press.


## How to:
Simply enter the text you want to analyze in the box. 

* Any unusal spacing will automatically be corrected.  
* Most of the analysis crucially depends upon identifying sentences. Therefore, do not omit punctuation that marks the end of a sentence (such as a period, question mark, exclamation point.)

* Select your target proficiency level - this will be used to find vocabulary and grammar from the textbook listed above.
* Optionally select the speech style you intended to use, especially if you want to check if you have used it consistently. You can also select multiple styles if your text does include multiple speech styles.

* Hit the submit button to see results.
* You can modify your text or options and hit the submit button again.

* Wait until cards appear at the bottom.

## Metrics:

### Number of content words:
This shows the number of content words (that is, excluding particles, English or other foreign words, arabic numbers, and predicate endings). This is an indication of length as well as your fluency. Click the box to see a word cloud generated based on your text!

### Variety of words:
This measure indicates the level of diversity in your vocabulary use, that is, if you have a variety of words or you use words repetitively. For instance, if your score is 0.5, it means half of your words out of all are unique. Click the box to see more.

### Number of potential errors:
This number is computed by using Naver spell check engine. It may over correct proper nouns and it won't pick up what would be an error in your text but is an existing word. In other words, semantic appropriacy is not considered. Click the box to see where the errors are in your text.

### New words used:
Number of words that you used from the specific level(s) that you selected. Click the box to see the list.

### New grammar used:
Number of grammar points that you used from the specific level(s) that you selected. Click the box to see the list.

* If the list does not show when you used a word that is supposed to be on the list, it is likely that you have typos and/or conjugation errors that caused incorrect tagging. 

## Diversity and complexity metrics:

### Number of words per sentence:
Number of words per sentence reflects your fluency as well as complexity of the text. Not all sentences in a writing need to be long and at the same length. Sentence length also may differ depending on what kind of text it is (e.g., genre, formality, colloquial vs written style, etc).

### Sentence complexity:
This measure indicates the average number of connectives and noun-modifying forms per sentence. Complex sentences can connect ideas to list, contrast, show sequence, reason, and so on. They also include relative clauses and/or modifications (complex noun phrases) that provide more information. Click this box to see more.


## Important Note:
Keep in mind that linguistic aspects of your writing is just part of what makes your writing good or bad. This report only evaluates the extent of linguistic variety and complexity you attempted to achieve. It does not speak to the content or organization and tells little about the accuracy and effectiveness of your language use.
